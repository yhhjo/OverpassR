Overpasser by UNC Hydrology
```

```
Overpasser is a satellite acquisition and planning software written by UNC Global Hydrology Lab. 
Researchers can use this tool to synchronize field research with overhead imaging. We built in Sentinal 2a/2b, Landsat 7, and Landsat 8 schedules. 
The Sentinel satellites are bundled into one acquisition calendar with a 5-day return period. 

Sentinel satellite image bounds rely on a Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) and Landsat uses World Reference System (WRS) tiles. 
Each tile provides a unique ID that can be used when downloading the images from ESA or USGS. 

Please send suggestions and bug reports to Andrew Buchanan at ajb28@live.unc.edu.
